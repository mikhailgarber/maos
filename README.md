MAOS stands for Meta Attribute Object Store

MAOS is my (one) weekend project. MAOS uses extremely popular Lucene Java library to implement simple key-value object store for Java objects.

It supports: basic Create-Read-Update-Delete (including bulk), search with multiple OR and AND criteria and also facets.

See StorageTest.java in tests for details on how to use it.
